Aim
To read five subject marks as integers from the user.
To compute the integer average of the five marks.
To display whether the student has passed (avg ≥ 50) or failed.
Algorithm
Read five space-separated integers representing marks in five subjects.
Accumulate the sum of the five marks.
Compute integer average = sum / 5.
Print "Average score: <avg>".
If avg ≥ 50, print "The student has passed".
Else, print "The student has failed".
End program.
Program (Java)
import java.util.*;
public class AveragePassFail {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt(), b = sc.nextInt(), c = sc.nextInt(), d = sc.nextInt(), e = sc.nextInt();
        int sum = a + b + c + d + e;
        int avg = sum / 5;
        System.out.println("Average score: " + avg);
        if (avg >= 50) {
            System.out.println("The student has passed");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The student has failed");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}


Sample Output
Average score: 70
The student has passed
Result
Successfully computed the average of five marks.
Correctly classified pass/fail based on the average ≥ 50.
