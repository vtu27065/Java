Aim
To compute regular percentage as (obtained / total) × 100.
To override calculation for scholarship student with +5% bonus.
To display both percentages to two decimal places.
Algorithm
Read total marks n and obtained marks m (integers).
Define base class with calculatePercentage(n, m).
Compute base = (m * 100.0) / n.
Define subclass overriding calculatePercentage to add +5.
Create objects of both classes and compute values.
Print values in required labeled format with two decimals.
End program.
Program (Java)
import java.util.*;
class Student {
    public double calculatePercentage(int total, int obtained){
        return (obtained * 100.0) / total;
    }
}
class ScholarshipStudent extends Student {
    @Override
    public double calculatePercentage(int total, int obtained){
        return super.calculatePercentage(total, obtained) + 5.0;
    }
}
public class PercentageOverride {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine().trim());
        int m = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine().trim());
        Student s = new Student();
        ScholarshipStudent ss = new ScholarshipStudent();
        System.out.printf("Student Percentage: %.2f%%%n", s.calculatePercentage(n, m));
        System.out.printf("Scholarship Student Percentage: %.2f%%%n", ss.calculatePercentage(n, m));
        sc.close();
    }
}


Sample Output
Student Percentage: 90.00%
Scholarship Student Percentage: 95.00%
Result
Demonstrated method overriding for specialized calculation.
Printed both regular and scholarship percentages as specified.
