Aim
To accept a sentence and a target word as input.
To count exact whole-word occurrences (case-sensitive).
To print the number of matches found in the sentence.
Algorithm
Read the full line (sentence) and then the target word.
Compile a regex with word boundaries for the target word.
Iterate over matcher.find() to count matches.
The match is case-sensitive by default.
Store and increment a counter for each match.
After scanning, print the count.
End program.
Program (Java)
import java.util.*;
import java.util.regex.*;
public class WordCount {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line = sc.nextLine();
        String word = sc.nextLine();
        String pattern = "\\b" + Pattern.quote(word) + "\\b";
        Matcher m = Pattern.compile(pattern).matcher(line);
        int count = 0;
        while (m.find()) count++;
        System.out.println(count);
        sc.close();
    }
}


Sample Output
Input word: happy
Output: 3
Result
Counted occurrences using regex word boundaries.
Maintained case sensitivity as per requirement.
